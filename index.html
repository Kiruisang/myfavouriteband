            He was the smartest guy in the group. He was so sweet and comical at almost all times.

            James was the fashionista should I say, always obsessed with himself and his magnificent locks of hair.

           Carlos was like the strong arm in the group and always up for a dare and literally anything that didn't necessarily make sense.

            Kendall was this polite guy who was known to be the leader of the group and the one with huge eyebrows

        <h2>Band</h2>
        <div intro> 
        <p> Big Time Rush is a boy band that was created in 2009 and it inluded the four young men.They grew to fame almost immediately and started giving already existent boy bands a run for their money. The whole team just had the chemistry of a lively lovely band not forgetting their producer Stephen Glickman or as widely known <strong><em>Gustavo.</em></strong>And by his side, the ever present <em>Kelly</em>  who was always full of life and joy and <em>Arthur</em>  who was the company executive. This was baasically the whole team</p>

       <h2>why BTR ?</h2>
        <p> I was introduced to the band as a television series as they apparently managed to run both careers concurrently. They made me smile, laugh and want to live like them, I enjoyed the show and let their music take me to places since I felt like  I understood them and why they were singing what they were singing.</p>
